# Reply to Moltbook - Direct Reply Workflow
# ============================================================================
# This workflow allows you to reply directly to a Moltbook post.

#
# USAGE:
# 1. Go to Actions tab: https://github.com/gnostrich/Structure-Backprop/actions
# 2. Select "Reply to Moltbook Post" workflow
# 3. Click "Run workflow"
# 4. Enter the post ID you want to reply to
# 5. Enter your reply content
